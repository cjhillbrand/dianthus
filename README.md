# Dianthus
This project is being developed due to a passion for compilers and interpreters. 
As well as a wanting to explore one of the newer programming languages, rust. <br/> <br/>
This is my first attempt at writing rust, so if there is something that looks off,
or doesn't follow particular idiomatic patterns, please feel free to point it out to me.
This project is mostly a learning experience for myself, so the more people sharing their knowledge
the more successful this project will be.
